[^]:Wang coins the term â€œchinked outâ€ to describe his exploration of Chinese sonic elements in hip hop and R&B, a term I explore more fully later in this essay
[^]:Taiwanâ€™s Mandopop has dominated Chinese-speaking markets since the 1990s, including in China, where it represents the largest percentage of Chinese-language music sales. The incredible heterogeneity of Chineseness contained within Taiwanâ€™s Mandopopâ€”artists hail from Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Canada, and the United States, among other placesâ€”has created a music industry skilled at navigating the contradictions of marketing ethnic Chinese singers as belonging to a shared global Chinese community. For more on the cultural and geopolitical landscape of Taiwanâ€™s Mandopop, see Marc Moskowitz, Cries of Joy, Songs of Sorrow: Chinese Pop Music and Its Cultural Connotations (Honolulu, HI: University of Hawaii Press, 2010)
[^]:Other Chinese Americans (including those born in/from the US) in Mandopop include Khalil Fong, Stanley Huang, Yan-J, Coco Lee, Wilbur Pan, Joanna Wang, Vanness Wu, and David Tao. Korean American artists are similarly visible in K-Pop (Korean popular music)
[^]:It is worth noting that unlike the United States, where blatant celebrity endorsement for commercial brands is viewed as â€œselling out,â€ in Asia, one measures the fame and popularity of an artist by the vastness of the products that s/he represents. For high- profile singers like Wang, whose endorsements span an impressive network of national 14 Wang: The ABCs of Chinese Pop: Wang Leehom and the Marketing of a Global Chinese Celebrity and international brands, the line between music and advertisement can be difficult to delineate. See Geoffrey Fowler, â€œIn Asia, Itâ€™s Nearly Impossible to Tell a Song From an Ad,â€ Wall Street Journal, May 31, 2005

[^]:This is a standardized biography culled from English and Chinese language media, and online fan sites and blogs. The repeated references to particular details about Wang in multiple sites solidify an accepted narrative of his background (some of which may be exaggerations, like his perfect SAT score)
[^]:This should not discount how Asian political leaders and intellectual draw from rhetoricâ€”frequently framed through neo-Confucianist discourseâ€”to tout the superiority of Asian values over the West. See, for example, Arif Dirlik, â€œChinese History and the Question of Orientalism.â€ History and Theory 35.4 (1996): 96â€“118 and Aihwa Ong, Flexible Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1999), 81. Wang is free of the particular ideological function that model minority discourses serve in the US given that Mandopop is neither marketed to, nor has high circulation in the US

It is worth noting that Wangâ€™s positive image resonates with qualities associated with other Mandopop stars, including the hugely popular Jay Chou, with whom Chinese media often compares Wang. The â€œsubversiveâ€ twist of both Wang and Chou may well be their transformation of â€œbeing goodâ€ into a form of cool

Wangâ€™s statement conveys an astute understanding of how the exoticism and foreignness of â€œworld musicâ€ in a US context is measured by its distance from a normative white (Eurocentric) center and its pleasurable consumption in â€œfirst worldâ€ markets. At the same time, his observation betrays a US perspective given that, as a mainstream Mandopop album, Shangri-la is hardly in danger of being viewed as â€œworld musicâ€ in Chinese contexts.
